# Image_sorting
This is a Repository for my first python project where It takes a folder and then will sort the images based on questions asked. It also will tell which ones are blurry if the user wants.

In here I will have the progress that I made to take it from v1 to v2. I hope to add to it more as I go along also.

# How to use 
1. You have to set the folder path. It is currently set to "sort_img" so change that to the correct folder you want to sort.
2. Run the program.
3. Follow the prompts to get your result.

# Supported image formats
1. '.jpg'
2. '.jpeg'
3. '.png'
